This is the code for Blogging-Platform-API. Its an small representation of how a Blooging Platform works. Where users can post/blog, add comments, follow unfollow each other.

This also uses **Relational Data** and **JPA** for data source.

This also implements various concepts of mappings like **One to One**, **One to Many**, etc.

This project is hosted on a remote server with a static IP.

This is the static IP along with swagger UI link **http://3.109.203.237:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/**.

- *They all extends JpaRepository Interface*.


## Database Design
- *In this section we used the models as mentioned in Model section, which are used as a table to store data*.
- *It also uses **Relational Database** and **JPA** to create datastructure*.
- *We use **MYSQL** which is a management system for relational data*

## Data Structure Used

- *We used **Relational database** along with **JPA** as the data source in this project*.

- *This kind of data persists forever and we use **SQL** to manipulate this data via MYSQL.*

- *The database of this project is hosted on a remote AWS server.*

- *That remote database server is used in our project which is also hosted on a remote AWS server, so that another person can access project.*
